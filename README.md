# James Harrison
`Python programmer & data lover`
 
  Hi Iâ€™m James, I'm a nineteen year old sproutling programmer & i'm aiming to develop my skills in programming & data science. I am ready to work on any project presented to me. However I often am studying or giving myself problems to solve (Thats 90% of the fun no?)

ðŸ¦­ - The things I hold close in this world consist of seals, programming, jjk, & of course my lovely girlfriend 
ðŸŒ± - Currently I am learning different libraries, specifically PyQt5 & Sqlite3
ðŸ’¬ - Reach out to me on Instagram @jamm3rzz I'm happy to learn or to just talk in general :)
